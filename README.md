# 💼 Salary Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

This repository contains a project that leverages multiple linear regression to estimate salaries based on key job features. It is designed to reveal insights into how factors like experience, education level, skill sets, and location influence compensation trends.

## 📌 Objectives
- Predict salary using multiple independent features
- Understand feature contributions and correlations
- Visualize data relationships and model performance

## 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes several job-related attributes, such as:
- Years of experience
- Education level
- Job role / domain
- Technical skillset
- Geographic location
- Reported salary

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python**: Data manipulation & modeling
- **pandas, numpy**: Data handling
- **scikit-learn / statsmodels**: Regression modeling
- **matplotlib, seaborn**: Visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** (optional): Interactive exploration

## 🧠 Model Highlights
- Implements multiple linear regression using `statsmodels` and/or `scikit-learn`
- Evaluates performance with metrics like R² score and RMSE
- Visualizes residuals and feature significance
- Supports insights into salary dynamics and equity analysis

## 📈 Results
The model provides a baseline for salary prediction and serves as a tool for job seekers, HR professionals, and analysts to make informed decisions. Visualization tools help interpret model performance and the influence of individual features.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. Load and inspect the dataset (`ai_job_dataset.csv`)  
4. Run the notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the model

## ✅ Contributions
Pull requests and discussions are welcome—especially around expanding the dataset, refining features, or incorporating advanced modeling techniques (e.g., regularization or ensemble methods).

Feel free to modify the code or add more advanced techniques
